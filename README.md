# EAGE_Hackathon_2017
This is the result of the Agile 2017 Paris Hackathon, a weekend of coding among friends with geophysical and computational skills.

## Scope of Project
We aim to help seismic interpreters in detecting interesting features within their seismic data. So far we can identify traps and faults,
we plan to train our model to identify more features in the future.

Using the Haar Cascade classifiers routines of [OpenCV library](http://opencv.org), we have trained various models, including beer bottles,
seismic traps and faults and
