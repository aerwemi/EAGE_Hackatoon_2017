#TO DO

- Expand seispy.GeologicalModelling module with classes for:
	- fault model
	- trap model
	- other geological plausible models


- Expand Create_Seismic_Dictionary.py code to create negatives from all geological models but one, and positive from remaining one (ideally positive are twice the number of and half of size of negatives)


- Download free datasets, http://wiki.seg.org/wiki/Open_data has extensive list and many of those can be retrieved as segy using already available Madagascar Sconstruct


- Write wrapper to Train_HaarCascade (either python or shell script)


- Work on web page that loads seismic image an detect a specific feature (given availability of pre-trained HaarCascade)
